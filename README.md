# C++ Module 05

This module explores C++ exceptions, abstract classes, inheritance, and factory patterns through a humorous bureaucracy simulation with Bureaucrats, Forms, and Interns.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./ex00
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./ex01
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./ex02
```

📂 ex03

```bash
cd ex03
make
./ex03
```

## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!:
Implement a Bureaucrat class with constant name and grade (1–150). Add grade increment/decrement, exceptions, and a stream insertion (<<) overload.

ex01 — Form up, maggots!:
Add a Form class requiring a grade to sign and execute. Bureaucrats can sign forms if their grade is high enough.

ex02 — No, you need form 28B, not 28C...:
Create an abstract AForm base class and concrete forms:
ShrubberyCreationForm, RobotomyRequestForm, and PresidentialPardonForm, each with unique behaviors and grade requirements. Implement form execution and error handling.

ex03 — At least this beats coffee-making:
Implement an Intern class with a makeForm() factory function that creates forms by name. Avoid ugly if/else chains; use elegant design.
